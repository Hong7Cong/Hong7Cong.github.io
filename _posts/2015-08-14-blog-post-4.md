In life, there are many difficult choices that force you to think about how to solve them. 2020 was really a turbulent year when the raging covid Pandemic changed all aspects of my life. The decisions I've made this year have been surprising and difficult because there are no right or wrong choices here. To make this even clearer, I'm going to talk about some of the memorable decisions of this year 2020.

First, choose to leave the current lab and go to work. And more broadly, leaving the orientation of studying abroad in Japan and following the study abroad scholarships of enterprises, specifically Vingroup. To make this more clear, I would like to tell about my situation at that time. Lab C is the 3rd lab that I applied to in my senior year of college when I didn't achieve anything in my old lab (F*L). In lab C, I finished publishing two scientific papers and learned many research skills. What I don't want to follow this lab is the way of working and the direction of research. The first thing about the working culture of the Orient is the relationship between top and bottom, students like good children always put below the teacher, always extremely respectful and must worship the teacher like kings. . This can be seen in my teacher and my teacher's teacher, he always does what pleases his teacher. That sometimes makes me feel frustrated and disliked at all. Secondly, the way of doing research is not practical, it is easy to publish such research but it has no applicability to social life. Just like making a paper doctorate, getting citations by self-citing in your own articles. If I were oriented to Japan, I would likely lose all my coding skills and go back to newspaper publishing pointlessly. Like a newspaper generator that lives through the day, not creating any mutations in the world. So, the decision to give up my orientation to Japan was really difficult, standing in front of my teacher on the one hand and on the other is my own life, I chose to do it for myself, not to live to please others. . It may sound selfish to hear this, but really, people don't die for themselves. At that time, it was really difficult to ask to leave the lab according to vingroup because my personality at that time was very gentle and respectful of my superiors.

Second, decide to go to America, Europe without choosing Australia, Singapore or Asia. Understandably, because it was in the midst of the covid pandemic, the US canceled the SAT GRE, so I could apply easily without having to take the exam.

The third is to decide whether to choose a future research direction Data science & Machine learning or follow traditional wireless communication now. It is difficult to know in the next 5-7 years how the world and especially Vietnam will develop and in what direction. Here poses a difficult problem when currently Vietnam can only do the parts about data, application layer in the upper layer, the type of outsourcing, but it is impossible not to develop core technology. Core technology is often transferred or imported and copied, but there is no R&D development team. All new technologies in the world are born in the West, China, ... then imported and imitated. Of course this is good for a country like Vietnam. Therefore, if in the direction of Data science & machine learning, the labor market in Vietnam will be more open in the next 5-7 years (I guess based on the current development), that is, I only process information based on data. on the available hard drives, no adjustments, no touching the physical layer, but also because of this, if I start a business I will need less hardware resources but compete quite strongly with a lot of people working in the field. this field. Quite frankly, I'm going to solve the existing problems, and improve on them. USC seems to be very well balanced in applying ML to dealing with wireless com issues. On the other hand, if I pursue wireless to the end, I will have the opportunity to develop prototypes, new products that create breakthroughs but come with risks of finding a job in Vietnam because I have to go back to Vietnam to work. work for Vin after 5-7 years of schooling. This is really risky, when VN now only needs people who work on the existing word base to not create new ones. Currently, I still have not given an answer, and am in need of advice from visionaries like the teachers at HUST, the lead teams in the business, contacting them is also quite difficult because of the connection in our business. I'm a bit weak. This I should improve myself when studying abroad, take a lot of intership in the summer to understand more about the world labor market.
