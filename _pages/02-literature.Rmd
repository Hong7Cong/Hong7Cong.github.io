# Motivations

In this section, we draw a big picture and define our ranking problems and sub-problems through the thinking flow of the authors. You may have different approaches. Feel free to think differently.

## Context

Imagine that you are given a list of images, you will have to order the images base
Before diving into severity ranking, let review what is learn-to-rank in machine learning.

"Any system that presents results to a user, ordered by a utility function that the user cares about, is performing a ranking function" - Learning to Rank using Gradient Descent, ICML.

In our particular case, the results are list of images and the utility function measure how severe an image is. Here, the annotation and concept may a little bit different from learn-to-rank by search engine. So, people who familiar with learn-to-rank for search engine may find this confuse.

## Problem statement

Given a list of images
